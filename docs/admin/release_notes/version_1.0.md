    Guiding Principles:

    - Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
    - There should be an entry for every single version.
    - The same types of changes should be grouped.
    - Versions and sections should be linkable.
    - The latest version comes first.
    - The release date of each version is displayed.
    - Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

    Types of changes:

    - `Added` for new features.
    - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
    - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
    - `Removed` for now removed features.
    - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
    - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
