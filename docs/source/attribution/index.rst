The library was built to be a centralized place for common network automation code to be accessed. While in most cases it is
difficult, if not impossible to understand the origin of code, the following intends to describe the known motivation for where
code was derived from and in the few cases where actual code was directly taken from. Except where noted, all code is believed to
be unattributable, from @itdependsnetworks, or another Network to Code resource. If this is in fact an error, please open an
issue, and the proper attribution will be provided. Any errors were not done out of malice, but rather the natural developer
workflow of pulling snippets of code from existing locations such as StackOverflow and Github over months and years of development.
As an example it is nearly impossible to understand the original author of Cisco type7 encryption/decryption in the sea of
available code, and remains unattributable though clearly originally developed prior to this library being created.
